    <p> officially the <b>Republic of Singapore</b>, is a sovereign island city-state
        in maritime Southeast Asia. It lies about one degree of latitude
        (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator, off the southern
        tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Straits of Malacca to the west,
        the Riau Islands to the south, and the South China Sea to the east.
        The country's territory is composed of one main island, 63 satellite
        islands and islets, and one outlying islet, the combined area of
        which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result
        of extensive land reclamation projects. The country is home to 5.6 million
        residents, 61% (3.4 million) of whom are Singaporean citizens. There are
        four official languages of Singapore: English, Malay, Chinese, and Tamil;
        with English being the lingua franca and Malay as the national language.
        This reflects in its rich cultural diversity and extensive ethnic cuisine
        and major festivals. Multiracialism is enshrined in the constitution,
        and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics.</p>
